                <p>
                    This visualization is for anyone interested in the migration waves across the globe. 
                    The message tells the reader which countries experience high emigration and high immigration over several decades. 
                    It also shows when there was an internal national conflict that caused many people to emigrate, and indicates to which countries those who fled the conflicts immigrated. 
                    Another question that one could consider is; why there was high emigration in one country and high immigration is another.  
                    The data encoded is the number of emigrants and immigrants, and from and to which countries. 
                    It also encodes time, separated by decades.
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>How does the visualization encode the data?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    The visualization is encoded by using a horizontal stream-like graph. 
                    It utilizes spatial perception to express the number of people traveling by encoding that data by area. 
                    The graph also uses color to encode another qualitative data, namely immigration-emigration. 
                    Since they are opposites, the choice to use black and white makes perfect sense. 
                    Additionally, it uses symbols to encode a ‘cause and effect’ type of change. 
                    For example, around 2012, there was a major conflict in Syria, causing millions of refugees to flee.
                    Where did this wave of refugees go? The visualization shows that those refugees went to Germany. 
                    This is indicated by a line that runs from the Syria wave to the Germany wave. 
                    The choice to measure immigration numbers on the x-axis is also intuitive to our imagination of a number line, with the center being 0 and the right indicating positive number and the left indicating negative numbers. 
                    (Emigration is encoded as a negative value while immigration is encoded as a positive value).
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>The Five Principles of Visualization</i></h5>
                <p>
                    It cannot be confirmed whether the numbers are truthful without cross-referencing data with the immigration office. 
                    Undocumented immigration is probably not included in the data. It is quite functional in looking up statistics of immigration and emigration. 
                    It is definitely beautiful. The color choice and usage of the x-axis are intuitive. 
                    The lines that run from one emigration country to another immigration country creates a simple symmetry and answers the question “where did the refugees go?” 
                    It follows the law that nothing can be created nor destroyed. It is both insightful and enlightening because it shows the ‘cause and effect’ in the visualization, along with a short description around the graph that further explains immigration trends. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization good?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    Considering the current public opinion on immigration, it is extremely insightful to visualize immigration trends across the globe. 
                    Immigration is a controversial topic that forces us to evaluate the practical resources and effects of allowing high immigration and questions our morals and willingness to help the ‘other’. 
                    With many voices rising across the Western world that speak against immigration, society needs to lead a discussion on immigration. 
                    One step is to visualize true data.

                        <p>
                            The audience is anyone. 
                            Adrian Brandon, the creator of this visualization writes: 
                            “This series is dedicated to the many black people that were robbed of their lives at the hands of the police… 
                            As a person of color, I know that my future can be stolen from me if I’m driving with a broken taillight, 
                            or playing my music too loud, or reaching for my phone at the wrong time. 
                            So for each of these portraits I played with the harsh relationship between time and death. 
                            I want the viewer to see how much empty space is left in these lives, stories that will never be told, space that can never be filled. 
                            This emptiness represents holes in their families and our community, who will be forever stuck with the question, 
                            “who were they becoming?” This series touches on grief and the unknown.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>What data and how is it encoded?</i></h5>
                        <p>
                            The data encoded is public data of the years of life of a handful of black people who were killed by police. 
                            The visualization uses area marks to show the years of life of the murdered black people. 
                            It uses color and area as channels to encode the years of the life the black people had. 
                            The absence of color shows the years of life they never got to have. 
                            The artist colors in a portrait of the deceased for one minute for every year of their life.

                        <div>
                            <strong>Truthful - </strong>
                            The information presented is public record so it is truthful and disclosed. 
                            However, it does not provide ALL available data of every black person murdered by police through time, 
                            we are aware of it and it is a relevant sample to get across a message. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Functional - </strong>
                            The data is clearly readable, as the precise age of death of each person is given next to their portrait. 
                            However, the author doesn’t show all the portraits and age data all at once, 
                            he shows the data of the individual portrait when clicked on, which could be a downside. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Beautiful - </strong>
                            The visualization is extremely beautiful. 
                            Adrian Brandon is obviously a talented artist who portrays the deceased in a powerful way that amplifies 
                            his message about the beauty of life and how it is taken away. 
                            There is no chart junk, and the designs are simple yet compelling. 

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Insightful - </strong>
                            The visualization shows a meaningful pattern that many black lives are being taken by police and a lot of them are extremely young. 
                            It gets the viewer to think more about this issue and would probably prompt them to do more research 
                            about related topics such as the “Black Lives Matter” movement. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Enlightening - </strong>
                            The visualization is extremely enlightening. The way the artist portrays the lives of those killed by 
                            police makes us think about how much of their lives they never got the chance to live. 
                            It makes the viewer feel something. Especially when watching the video of the artist drawing the portraits 
                            we are left with a feeling of emptiness when the drawing is suddenly stopped at minute (age) of their death.

                    <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Why is this visualization good?</h5>
                    <p>
                        This is an amazing visualization. It was selected by the creator of visualizingdata.com as one of the top visualizatoins 
                        on the web discovered in June 2020. I believe the reason being is that where this visualization lacks technicality 
                        it makes up for in the extreme emotional response felt by the viewers. Looking at each of the faces in the portrait the 
                        viewer develops a connection to the life of each person. It’s so powerful it can really prompt the audience to do something 
                        about the issue it portrays by possibly doing research or making a change in their own opinions/habits/beliefs which is one 
                        of the most important things a visualization can do.

                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">By Charles Schwab</h6>
                <p>
                    This visualization is for those who are interested in building an investment portfolio 
                    and those who are interested in seeing a portfolio breakdown in categories of different investments.
                    There are more questions than messages in this visualization. 
                    It is not immediately clear that the 3D pie charts are conveying a before/after image. 
                    It is also hard to interpret the data accurately with 3D models. 
                    It conveys the message that stock prices have dropped following market correction. 
                    Data encoded are the stock, bond, cash investment, and total values in dollars. 
                    It is also encoded in percentages and displayed in a pie chart. 
                    The visualization is encoded using a pie chart. Using a pie chart takes advantage of our vision’s spatial 
                    interpretation to see the size difference between the categories of investments. 
                    Almost none of the five principles are applied in this visualization. 
                    The color-code might make the visualization slightly “beautiful.” 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Why is this visualization bad?</h5>
                <p>
                    It is bad for many reasons. The visualization only shows the portfolio values in two time points (Zeitpunkte). 
                    It would be much more helpful to show a trend over an extended time period, since the description says 
                    “after a rough few months.” A pie chart encodes the data in percentages, which is extremely misleading. 
                    By looking at the actual values of the different portfolio categories, one can see that the only value 
                    that changed was the stock prices. However, because the pie chart encodes percentages, a change in just one category 
                    will change the percentage of every category, even though the actual values of bonds and cash investments haven’t changed. 
                    3D depiction is also misleading. The percentages are expressed in the percent of 360 degrees to make up the pie chart. 
                    The 2D areas would be a little more proportional to the percentages, but the heights of each category is also proportionalized, 
                    resulting in a “double-count” of the percent differences.

                            In this redesign, (which was suggested by the creator of the original blog post) I used a line graph for each category of the portfolio. 
                            Each asset type is color coded as well. In this visualization, it becomes clear which of the asset types contribute to the change in portfolio value 
                            and shows that the other asset types are constant. The line graph displays a clearer trend. My redesign does not utilize 3D pie charts, 
                            which are misleading. The line graph, (if more data were available) could also show the fluctuations of the asset types and total portfolio value. 
                            This redesign is easier to comprehend than the original 3D pie chart. It improves the functional, insightfulness, and enlightening aspects of a good visualization. 
                            The tradeoff made in this redesign is the visual appeal of a pie chart, replaced with simplistic lines.

                            In the second redesign, a stacked bar chart was used to encode the asset types and total portfolio value. 
                            This design allows easier comparison of the whole portfolio value between the starting portfolio and the 
                            after-market correction value. Usually, it is harder to compare the parts (asset types) against other parts 
                            of another stacked bar, but in this case, but starting the cash investment and bonds at the same point, 
                            a viewer can tell that those asset types have maintained the same value, and that the only asset type that 
                            changed was the stock value. The tradeoff made in this redesign is the ‘beauty’ of the visualization. 
                            The redesign is not a 3D pie chart, which may be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

                            In the third redesign, a streamgraph was used to encode the data. By using a streamgraph, 
                            it shows the fluctuations of asset type values over time. Compared to the original visualization, 
                            each asset type is drawn on its own line so the change of value of another asset type does not visually 
                            affect the asset value of another type. The biggest improvement with the streamgraph is that it can easily 
                            show fluctuation over time, and the time variable is shown as a fluid data across the graph, which is much 
                            harder to show on a pie chart because a pie chart can show data at one time point. If the pie chart design 
                            attempts to show changes in data through time, it would need multiple pie charts. The tradeoff with this 
                            visualization is that it is difficult to evaluate part-over-whole comparisons. In the streamgraph, all asset 
                            types start from $0 at the origin of the graph. In the pie chart and the stacked bar graph, the different 
                            asset types have a starting point that builds on top of another asset type, making it easier to make 
                            part-over-whole comparisons. However, there is an upside to this design as well. It is easier to find the 
                            difference in value between the different asset types since they are all graphed from the 0 origin.
