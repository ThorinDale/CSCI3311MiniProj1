                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">By National Geographic</h6>
                <p>
                    This visualization is for anyone interested in the migration waves across the globe. 
                    The message tells the reader which countries experience high emigration and high immigration over several decades. 
                    It also shows when there was an internal national conflict that caused many people to emigrate, and indicates to which countries those who fled the conflicts immigrated. 
                    Another question that one could consider is; why there was high emigration in one country and high immigration is another.  
                    The data encoded is the number of emigrants and immigrants, and from and to which countries. 
                    It also encodes time, separated by decades.
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>How does the visualization encode the data?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    The visualization is encoded by using a horizontal stream-like graph. 
                    It utilizes spatial perception to express the number of people traveling by encoding that data by area. 
                    The graph also uses color to encode another qualitative data, namely immigration-emigration. 
                    Since they are opposites, the choice to use black and white makes perfect sense. 
                    Additionally, it uses symbols to encode a ‘cause and effect’ type of change. 
                    For example, around 2012, there was a major conflict in Syria, causing millions of refugees to flee.
                    Where did this wave of refugees go? The visualization shows that those refugees went to Germany. 
                    This is indicated by a line that runs from the Syria wave to the Germany wave. 
                    The choice to measure immigration numbers on the x-axis is also intuitive to our imagination of a number line, with the center being 0 and the right indicating positive number and the left indicating negative numbers. 
                    (Emigration is encoded as a negative value while immigration is encoded as a positive value).
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>The Five Principles of Visualization</i></h5>
                <p>
                    It cannot be confirmed whether the numbers are truthful without cross-referencing data with the immigration office. 
                    Undocumented immigration is probably not included in the data. It is quite functional in looking up statistics of immigration and emigration. 
                    It is definitely beautiful. The color choice and usage of the x-axis are intuitive. 
                    The lines that run from one emigration country to another immigration country creates a simple symmetry and answers the question “where did the refugees go?” 
                    It follows the law that nothing can be created nor destroyed. It is both insightful and enlightening because it shows the ‘cause and effect’ in the visualization, along with a short description around the graph that further explains immigration trends. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization good?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    Considering the current public opinion on immigration, it is extremely insightful to visualize immigration trends across the globe. 
                    Immigration is a controversial topic that forces us to evaluate the practical resources and effects of allowing high immigration and questions our morals and willingness to help the ‘other’. 
                    With many voices rising across the Western world that speak against immigration, society needs to lead a discussion on immigration. 
                    One step is to visualize true data.

                        <p>
                            The audience is anyone. 
                            Adrian Brandon, the creator of this visualization writes: 
                            “This series is dedicated to the many black people that were robbed of their lives at the hands of the police… 
                            As a person of color, I know that my future can be stolen from me if I’m driving with a broken taillight, 
                            or playing my music too loud, or reaching for my phone at the wrong time. 
                            So for each of these portraits I played with the harsh relationship between time and death. 
                            I want the viewer to see how much empty space is left in these lives, stories that will never be told, space that can never be filled. 
                            This emptiness represents holes in their families and our community, who will be forever stuck with the question, 
                            “who were they becoming?” This series touches on grief and the unknown.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>What data and how is it encoded?</i></h5>
                        <p>
                            The data encoded is public data of the years of life of a handful of black people who were killed by police. 
                            The visualization uses area marks to show the years of life of the murdered black people. 
                            It uses color and area as channels to encode the years of the life the black people had. 
                            The absence of color shows the years of life they never got to have. 
                            The artist colors in a portrait of the deceased for one minute for every year of their life.

                        <div>
                            <strong>Truthful - </strong>
                            The information presented is public record so it is truthful and disclosed. 
                            However, it does not provide ALL available data of every black person murdered by police through time, 
                            we are aware of it and it is a relevant sample to get across a message. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Functional - </strong>
                            The data is clearly readable, as the precise age of death of each person is given next to their portrait. 
                            However, the author doesn’t show all the portraits and age data all at once, 
                            he shows the data of the individual portrait when clicked on, which could be a downside. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Beautiful - </strong>
                            The visualization is extremely beautiful. 
                            Adrian Brandon is obviously a talented artist who portrays the deceased in a powerful way that amplifies 
                            his message about the beauty of life and how it is taken away. 
                            There is no chart junk, and the designs are simple yet compelling. 

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Insightful - </strong>
                            The visualization shows a meaningful pattern that many black lives are being taken by police and a lot of them are extremely young. 
                            It gets the viewer to think more about this issue and would probably prompt them to do more research 
                            about related topics such as the “Black Lives Matter” movement. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <strong>Enlightening - </strong>
                            The visualization is extremely enlightening. The way the artist portrays the lives of those killed by 
                            police makes us think about how much of their lives they never got the chance to live. 
                            It makes the viewer feel something. Especially when watching the video of the artist drawing the portraits 
                            we are left with a feeling of emptiness when the drawing is suddenly stopped at minute (age) of their death.

                    <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization good?</i></h5>
                    <p>
                        This is an amazing visualization. It was selected by the creator of visualizingdata.com as one of the top visualizatoins 
                        on the web discovered in June 2020. I believe the reason being is that where this visualization lacks technicality 
                        it makes up for in the extreme emotional response felt by the viewers. Looking at each of the faces in the portrait the 
                        viewer develops a connection to the life of each person. It’s so powerful it can really prompt the audience to do something 
                        about the issue it portrays by possibly doing research or making a change in their own opinions/habits/beliefs which is one 
                        of the most important things a visualization can do.

                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">By Stuart A. Thompson and Yaryna Serkez</h6>
                <p>
                    The audience is anyone trying to understand how and to what extent climate change will threaten various counties in the United States.
                    This visualization conveys the complexity of climate change, as this visualization shows there are a variety of ways that the United States 
                    will be threatened. Additionally, this image conveys the scope of climate change since almost no county on this map is indicated as having no risk of climate threat. 
                    Overall, this visualization answers how climate change will manifest itself based on where you live in the US. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>What data and how is it encoded?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    The data encoded is the most predominant climate threat by county in the United States, state borders, and the level of risk that climate threat poses.
                    The visualization encodes areas with white lines representing state borders and faint gray lines to represent the United States borders. 
                    To encode the various most dominant climate threats by area, the visualization uses the channels of different color hues in addition to saturation, 
                    which shows the level of risk of the respective climate threat. 
                    Readers will identify extremes and perform comparisons by looking at saturation in order to assess which areas of the country are at the greatest risk 
                    for their respective climate threat. Further, readers will compare the color hues of different areas of the country to determine which will face similar 
                    climate threats and which will face a different climate threat. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">The Five Principles of Visualization</h5>
                <p>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Truthful -</strong>
                        This visualization is truthful because the creators disclosed their sources and the publication they made this for. 
                        Further, the data aligns with knowledge I’ve received from other sources, such as the news about wildfires in California, 
                        increase in hurricanes, and rising sea levels along the coast. Thirdly, the creators are careful to not leave out the difference 
                        between what’s the most pressing climate threat in an area and how much risk that threat poses, a distinction I find important 
                        to not mislead people. 
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Functional -</strong>
                        This visualization is very functional because it’s readable and easy to make comparisons between various data expressed. 
                        The encodings are also effective because the degree of risk is shown with ranges of saturation which we can understand through perceptual 
                        ordering. Further, the various color hues are intuitive as categorical differences between the variety of climate threats. 
                        Also, many of the color hues intuitively relate to the climate threat at hand. For example, fires are encoded by red, heat encoded as orange, 
                        and extreme rainfall as blue – all colors we associate with each of these phenomena.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Beautiful -</strong>
                        The aesthetics of this visualization are great. The colors do not strain the eye and there are clean lines. The map has also been simplified to 
                        what’s important to show and any extra markings have been left out.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Insightful -</strong>
                        This visual is very insightful because it turns the complex issue of climate change and the vast amounts of data that go into forecasting climate 
                        risks into a tangible and understandable representation. Climate change is a phenomena a lot of people don’t see as a pressing issue, let alone 
                        something that will affect us because it poses long term and slow-developping risks, something humans naturally are not very good at responding to. 
                        This map communicates how pervasive and severe climate change is in a very accessible way. 
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Enlightening -</strong>
                        This visual is very enlightening because it encourages people to understand how harmful actions to the planet are affecting and going to affect fellow 
                        Americans in a variety of devastating ways across the country. This visualization could mobilize more people to take a stand against corporations and 
                        individual action harming the planet as well as to propose solutions targetted for each area’s respective climate threat. 
                    </div>
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization good?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    Considering the state of our country, the upcoming election, and the pressing issue, I find this visualization overall excellent and relevant. 
                    A variety of people understandably have difficulty perceiving climate change. For some, this does not hold people back from pushing for climate action and 
                    changing their own ways. Unfortunately, many people take another stance and take the complexity and lack of visibility as a sign that climate change is a hoax. 
                    This visualization is in no way a cure-all for climate denial; however, it is certainly an easy-to-read and aesthetically pleasing contribution to helping people 
                    understand that no matter where they live, they will be affected by this disaster. Further, it encourages people to connect the changes they are seeing in their 
                    own hometowns with the threats posed on the map and realize they are a product of our inaction to solving climate change.

                    This visualization is for those who are interested in building an investment portfolio 
                    and those who are interested in seeing a portfolio breakdown in categories of different investments.
                    There are more questions than messages in this visualization. 
                    It is not immediately clear that the 3D pie charts are conveying a before/after image. 
                    It is also hard to interpret the data accurately with 3D models. 
                    It conveys the message that stock prices have dropped following market correction. 
                    Data encoded are the stock, bond, cash investment, and total values in dollars. 
                    It is also encoded in percentages and displayed in a pie chart. 
                    The visualization is encoded using a pie chart. Using a pie chart takes advantage of our vision’s spatial 
                    interpretation to see the size difference between the categories of investments. 
                    Almost none of the five principles are applied in this visualization. 
                    The color-code might make the visualization slightly “beautiful.” 
                </p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization bad?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    It is bad for many reasons. The visualization only shows the portfolio values in two time points (Zeitpunkte). 
                    It would be much more helpful to show a trend over an extended time period, since the description says 
                    “after a rough few months.” A pie chart encodes the data in percentages, which is extremely misleading. 
                    By looking at the actual values of the different portfolio categories, one can see that the only value 
                    that changed was the stock prices. However, because the pie chart encodes percentages, a change in just one category 
                    will change the percentage of every category, even though the actual values of bonds and cash investments haven’t changed. 
                    3D depiction is also misleading. The percentages are expressed in the percent of 360 degrees to make up the pie chart. 
                    The 2D areas would be a little more proportional to the percentages, but the heights of each category is also proportionalized, 
                    resulting in a “double-count” of the percent differences.

                            In this redesign, (which was suggested by the creator of the original blog post) I used a line graph for each category of the portfolio. 
                            Each asset type is color coded as well. In this visualization, it becomes clear which of the asset types contribute to the change in portfolio value 
                            and shows that the other asset types are constant. The line graph displays a clearer trend. My redesign does not utilize 3D pie charts, 
                            which are misleading. The line graph, (if more data were available) could also show the fluctuations of the asset types and total portfolio value. 
                            This redesign is easier to comprehend than the original 3D pie chart. It improves the functional, insightfulness, and enlightening aspects of a good visualization. 
                            The tradeoff made in this redesign is the visual appeal of a pie chart, replaced with simplistic lines.

                            In the second redesign, a stacked bar chart was used to encode the asset types and total portfolio value. 
                            This design allows easier comparison of the whole portfolio value between the starting portfolio and the 
                            after-market correction value. Usually, it is harder to compare the parts (asset types) against other parts 
                            of another stacked bar, but in this case, but starting the cash investment and bonds at the same point, 
                            a viewer can tell that those asset types have maintained the same value, and that the only asset type that 
                            changed was the stock value. The tradeoff made in this redesign is the ‘beauty’ of the visualization. 
                            The redesign is not a 3D pie chart, which may be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

                            In the third redesign, a streamgraph was used to encode the data. By using a streamgraph, 
                            it shows the fluctuations of asset type values over time. Compared to the original visualization, 
                            each asset type is drawn on its own line so the change of value of another asset type does not visually 
                            affect the asset value of another type. The biggest improvement with the streamgraph is that it can easily 
                            show fluctuation over time, and the time variable is shown as a fluid data across the graph, which is much 
                            harder to show on a pie chart because a pie chart can show data at one time point. If the pie chart design 
                            attempts to show changes in data through time, it would need multiple pie charts. The tradeoff with this 
                            visualization is that it is difficult to evaluate part-over-whole comparisons. In the streamgraph, all asset 
                            types start from $0 at the origin of the graph. In the pie chart and the stacked bar graph, the different 
                            asset types have a starting point that builds on top of another asset type, making it easier to make 
                            part-over-whole comparisons. However, there is an upside to this design as well. It is easier to find the 
                            difference in value between the different asset types since they are all graphed from the 0 origin.

                <p>
                    Anyone, probably as young as teens, people interested in technology jobs, employment, Google, etc. 
                    This visualization conveys information on the top 10 salaries at Google by job category. 
                    The data encoded is self-reported salaries from employees at Google. The data shows a range from lowest 
                    salary reported to highest salary reported for each job category. The data is compiled from the website 
                    Glassdoor and the chart is created by JobVine. 
                    This visualization uses a kind of stacking pie chart or radial bar chart to encode the data. 
                    It uses area as marks to show the salary range of each job title. For channels it uses color to encode job title, 
                    and area and angle to encode salary range.

                <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization bad?</i></h5>
                <p>
                    This visualization is bad for many reasons. First of all, the visualization is FILLED with chart junk, there are so many labels, 
                    unnecessary graphics like the stick figures, and lines. Additionally, the designer uses a kind of stacking pie chart (?) or a circular bar chart 
                    which is difficult to read given some slices are hidden underneath other slices, this gives the idea that the designer may be trying to hide information. 
                    Also, the slices are difficult to compare because some are extremely similar looking in size and require labels to be compared accurately. 
                    The slices also do not add up to 100% or are not “pieces of a whole” so it is confusing why the designer would select this circular method of a chart. 
                    Consequently, the chart is extremely cluttered, and doesn’t have a general path for the eye to follow. It is also slightly confusing how the rankings of 
                    highest paid to lowest paid is established because we don’t have the actual data. For example, the Project management director is regarded as the second 
                    highest salary with maximum salary at 218k even though Directors have a higher maximum salary of 231k but are regarded as the third highest salary. 
                    It’s possible they used averages, but we don’t have the raw data and the word “average” isn’t used in the chart, so it’s unclear.

                            For channels, it uses length and position to encode the salary range for each job title.

                        My redesign uses a different method to portray the information which is a floating bar chart and uses length and position to encode data 
                        rather than angle and area. It also does not use color to encode any data. It is extremely simple, and contains no chart junk. 
                        My redesign is a lot less cluttered than the original, and contains no chart junk. It contains no unnecessary labeling or coloring. 
                        It conveys information in an easier to interpret way because it uses length and position to encode the relevant data rather than angle and area. 
                        Length and position are ranked higher in effectiveness for the quantitative data than angle and area. The bars are easier to compare because they 
                        are separated using the same scale for each bar but still compact. It is organized in a logical way where the viewer can easily see the ranking from 
                        highest salary (at the top) to lowest salary (at the bottom).
                        There is still the issue that it is slightly confusing how the rankings of highest paid to lowest paid is established because we don’t have the actual data. 
                        For example, the Project management director is regarded as the second highest salary with maximum salary at 218k even though Directors have a higher maximum

                        My redesign isn’t as interesting and “fun” as the original because it lacks varying bright colors and the radial beauty of the original. My redesign is slightly 
                        less specific because I don’t have the exact salary ranges labeled for each job title like in the original.

                    The audience of this Visualization is anyone who does not know which countries qualify as “Latino”,  “Hispanic”, or both. 
                    This visualization conveys that there’s a lot of crossover between these two terms; however it raises questions as to why 
                    certain countries are not included under each term and what warrants certain countries as both “Latino” and “Hispanic”. 
                    Overall, the definition of these terms remains unclear. 
                    The data encoded is countries that classify as “Latino”, “Hispanic” or both. 
                    This visualization encodes “Hispanic”, “Latino”, or “Hispanic” and “Latino” countries with a venn diagram using overlapping 
                    circles as marks and the channels of two color hues and cross of the two hues to represent these categories. There is redundant 
                    encoding of data in this venn diagram with “Does NOT include” sections. 
                    Readers can perform comparisons between countries and identifications of individual countries  as “Hispanic”, “Latino”, or both; 
                    however, it is considerably difficult to find patterns in what garners these differences among the countries beyond the label of 
                    “Latino” and “Hispanic”.

                    <strong>Truthful: </strong>: The information displayed in this venn diagram is relatively correct after research. The issue is there is no reputable 
                    source displayed and there’s missing information such as how the visualization is defining  “Latino” and “Hispanic” 
                    <strong>Functional: </strong> Overall, this visualization is not functional. Although the visualization informs the audience of which countries it’s 
                    labelling as “hispanic” or “latino” or both with easily perceived overlapping circles and proper color coding, there is no information on the meaning 
                    of these labels. The redundancy of “Does NOT include” is also confusing and misleading.
                    <strong>Beautiful: </strong> The colors of this visualization are not aesthetically pleasing, the country names are squished together and hard to read, 
                    and overally the visualization is boring. 
                    <strong>Insightful: </strong> This visualization is not very insightful because I am left wondering what differentiates these countries definitively and 
                    it’s difficult to see any patterns to attempt to determine what’s differentiating them or placing them in the same category. 
                    <strong>Enlightening: </strong> This visualization does not contribute anything important and is also outdated in terms of social progress by still ui. 
                    In America, due to a history of subjugation and oppression, there is a lack of education on spanish-speaking people and those from Latin America. As a result, 
                    many Americans confuse “hispanic” and what is now labelled “Latinx”. Because this visualization only names which countries fall under each label without defining 
                    any reasoning, it provides minimal progress to the cultural erasure of Latin America and Spanish-speaking people and continues the confusion.

                    <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><i>Why is this visualization bad?</i></h5>
                    Overall, this visualization is bad because of its poor aesthetics, missing information, and redundancy of data that confuses the audience over emphasizing meaning. 
                    The visualization does a poor job drawing in the audience with its boring color scheme and cluttering of data. The visualization provides very little clarity on what 
                    qualifies country’s as “hispanic” or “latino”.

                    In this visualization, I chose to use a three-column chart. I used rectangular areas to mark the categorical encapsulation. Then I used the channel of color hue to emphasize 
                    the difference between Latinx and Hispanic as well as an intermediate color hue to represent the intersection of the two categories. 
                    In comparison to the original, I used a column chart instead of a venn diagram. I also changed the color scheme and removed the “does not include” aspects of the venn diagram. 
                    I added images related to the labels’ definitions, short definitions, a source, and changed the fonts. 
                    In comparison to the original, this visualization seems more truthful because there is a source and information on the meanings of the labels between the added definition and correlated images. 
                    This visualization is easier to read because of the adjusted spacing within a rectangular format over a circular format. I found it difficult to read the countries in the original because 
                    they are placed so closely together Further, this visualization is more inviting and interesting than the original because I improved the aesthetics of the color scheme and fonts to be cleaner and brighter.

                    In the original visualization, geographical areas are represented. In relation to charts, a map does a better job implying location; however, for the data displayed, extensive information on location is unnecessary. 
                    Further, a map would make it harder to see the names of the countries. Instead, the data only requires a simple chart defining the labels of Hispanic and Latinx
